# Gangeroni Mods
Gangeroni mods is a bundle of custom mods I made for my gang, but feel free to use it as well! This mod is useful for many small things and adds some more fun to the game!

## Features:
### Terminal:
New commands:
1. Toggle Lights command: Have you ever been playing with the bois, and as usual, the light switch hiding shenanigans begin? This quick command lets you turn the ship lights on or off. (I added this for obvious reasons) To use: `lights`

### Items:
New Scrap:
1. Added Blahaj the shark, a super rare item with a `1%` chance of spawning that is worth from 874.8 to 1150 value;
